## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Testing

Currently, the project uses build tests to ensure the package compiles correctly. In the future, we plan to add:

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Visual regression tests
